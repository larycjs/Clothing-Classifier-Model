# Clothing-Classifier-Model
Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify clothing images in the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch. I trained the model to recognize different types of clothes, optimizing its accuracy using advanced image processing techniques.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies used: PyTorch, Torchvision, convolutional neural networks (CNN), optimization with Adam.
ðŸ”¹ Results: I achieved 87.98% classification accuracy, with detailed performance metrics (precision and recall per class).
ðŸ”¹ Application: This type of model can be used in fashion recommendation systems, inventory automation or retail image analysis.
